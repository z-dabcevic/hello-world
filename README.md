# hello-world

Student at Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture, specializations in mechatronics and robotics.

I am confident in my abilities to produce. I am a problem-solver and someone who demonstrates an unwavering resolve to do whatever must be done to produce the best long-term results, no matter how difficult. I seek new challenges and try to think out-of-the-box while looking for creative solutions to a given problem. I am not afraid to take risks and do things differently. I think itâ€™s important to approach tasks and issues from different angles, rather than just doing what has always been done. By having an open mind and taking a different approach, I believe you can find new and improved ways of doing things. I have a pragmatic approach to things - one question matters to me: "Does it work or not?". Every day I work to improve myself and my skills - that's part of becoming better at what I do.
